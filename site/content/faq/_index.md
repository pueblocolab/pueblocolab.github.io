| ![Founder](/images/cathy_resize.png)  | _Cathy, Consultant_ - With 10 years experience in government consulting, international NGOs, non-profits and even a technology startup, Cathy has seen it all. In her career, she's also had the good fortune to work with amazing people and projects in Costa Rica, Mexico, Kenya, Zimbabwe, India and South Africa.
